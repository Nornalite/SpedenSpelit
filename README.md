# SpedenSpelit
Year 1 group project to build a reaction speed game based on the Finnish gameshow Speden Spelit. 
The project wasn't completed using GitHub/other version control tools, so here's a copy of the codes and a description for résumé purposes.

## Participants
Me, [@KarolusPaulus](https://github.com/KarolusPaulus), [@nidacnr](https://github.com/nidacnr) and [@Tappivanukas2](https://github.com/Tappivanukas2).

## So what's this thing?
Randomised buttons light up at an ever increasing pace and the player has to slap them in the correponding order (and avoid falling seriously behind). An incorrect press ends the game. The goal is to get as high a score as possible.

In addition we added a simple soundtrack and eye lights and messages that ramp up as your score increases.
